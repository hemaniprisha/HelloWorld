# Hello World Intro App

A simple Android app built in Android Studio that serves as a personal introduction. The app displays an image of R2-D2 (just for fun), a short introduction about me, and a button labeled "Hello There!". When the button is clicked, a popup appears with the response "General Kenobi!".
